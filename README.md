## [On Stage: Robots as Performers](http://guyhoffman.com/publications/HoffmanRSS11Workshop.pdf)

### Introduction:

Getting insights performative arts could help improve the coordination and joint-action timing of human-robot interaction(HRI). It's important to improve these characters because these improvements make those robots look more "natural"(human-like).

### I. Robots on Stage
Two things must be put into consideration when having robots on stage:
  1. Preprogrammed actions:
      - robots are pre-programmed to certain verbal cues and postions to perform particular set of actions. While this looks  
        responsive, it lacks the natural fluency of behaviors that human actors have on stage
   2. Realtime actions:
      - using a "real-time adaptive and autonomatic robotic improvisation system"
      - robots are synchronized with the human player to simultaneously response to other actors(humans and robots)
      
### II. Robots on Stage
Two lessons robots can learn from human actors:    
1. Conintuity- inner monologue:
       - An actor's inner monologue is shown through out the play through actions or monologue-this in term creates a   
         narrative for that actor
       - Implement to robots to create a "more fluent and acceptance in human-robot joint activities"
            - could be implemented by making the robot activity continuous
2. Responsiveness:
      - "a scene is not happening within any of the actorâ€™s minds"
      - Robot's responsiveness is based on their interaction with other actors(humans and other robots)
          - quick responses: some responses are based on incomplete information-makes it natural in a way because human
            tend to act that way  


## Project Propsoal

### I. About the class performance

  Since this is a performing robots class, we could have stage where our robots could be staged to do their own thing. The audience could either focus on each robot to see in detail what are the robot's specialties. In addition, the audience could look at the performing as a whole and try to create a story of what is going on with all the robots. Some people might think that those robots are doing nothing in relation to other robots, but some people might try to draw some connections between those robots to create stories. Thus, audience might see the stage as a big chaos or a beautifully-weaved story.
  
 ### II. What I want to make: Humanoid robot
 
  -consists of a lot motors to recreate the joints that humans have so the robot could move "fluently"

  I will try to make those joints work by testing the implemenation of different motors at those joints.

I. About the class performance

  Since this is a performing robots class, we could have stage where our robots could be staged to do their own thing. The audience could either focus on each robot to see in detail what are the robot's specialties. In addition, the audience could look at the performing as a whole and try to create a story of what is going on with all the robots. Some people might think that those robots are doing nothing in relation to other robots, but some people might try to draw some connections between those robots to create stories. Thus, audience might see the stage as a big chaos or a beautifully-weaved story.
  
 II. What I want to make: Humanoid robot
 
  -consists of a lot motors to recreate the joints that humans have so the robot could move "fluently"

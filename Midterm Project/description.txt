We are making a jellyfish Robot. The JellyBot is composed of 3 main parts:

A traction system.

The jellyfish body.

The 4 tentacles of the jellyfish.

The features that we've already done:

Built a body out of cardboard and painted it blue, with holes for the light, with tracing paper on top.

Neopixels that shift between blue and purple inside the body.

Built a support for the lifting mechanism.

Built the basics for the legs and tested servos on them.

The features that we want for sure to include in our JellyBot are (including partially completed ones), which will make our JellyBot "complete":

All the parts are assembled together

An autonomous lifting mechanism, with a spring between the mechanism and the body.

Lights coming out of the body.

Legs that move automatically, using randomness or noise.

Features that we might add depending on time and constraints:

Wireless controls for the lift.

Lights that react to a distance sensor.

Legs that react to the distance sensor, maybe becoming wilder as people get closer.

Springs between the body and the legs.

On Stage: Robots as Performers (http://guyhoffman.com/publications/HoffmanRSS11Workshop.pdf)

Introduction:

Getting insights performative arts could help improve the coordination and joint-action timing of human-robot interaction(HRI). It's important to improve these characters because these improvements make those robots look more "natural"(human-like).

I. Robots on Stage
Two things must be put into consideration when having robots on stage:
  1. Preprogrammed actions:
      - robots are pre-programmed to certain verbal cues and postions to perform particular set of actions. While this looks  
        responsive, it lacks the natural fluency of behaviors that human actors have on stage
   2. Realtime actions:
      - using a "real-time adaptive and autonomatic robotic improvisation system"
      - robots are synchronized with the human player to simultaneously response to other actors(humans and robots)
II. Acting lessons for HRI
    1. Conintuity- inner monologue
       - An actor's inner monologue is shown through out the play through actions or monologue-this in term creates a   
         narrative for that actor
       - Implement to robots to create a "more fluent and acceptance in human-robot joint activities"
            - could be implemented by making the robot activity continuous
    2. Responsiveness:
      - "a scene is not happening within any of the actorâ€™s minds"
      - Robot's responsiveness is based on their interaction with other actors(humans and other robots)
          - quick responses: some responses are based on incomplete information-makes it natural in a way because human
            tend to act that way
